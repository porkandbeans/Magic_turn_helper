this application is designed to be used with an android device.
however, it is made primarily from HTML, CSS and Javascript,
so I have decided to include an HTML5 version.

To install for android: extract "Turn_helper.apk" and open it
on your android device.

To view on a desktop PC (not reccommended unless looking at source):
extract the HTML folder to a location of your choosing, navigate to
it and open "magic_phaser.html" in any web browser.

If the app doesn't work in a web browser:
- Make sure the files are all extracted to the same directory
- Make sure your web browser supports HTML 5
- Make sure javascript is turned on https://enable-javascript.com/

if all else fails, contact me.
